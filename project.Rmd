### Research puzzle

I am interested in how Egyptian public opinion shifts after the adoption of anti-terror law in Egypt. Specifically, I am interested in exploring polarization between secularists and Islamists as anti-terror law, by nature, targets Islamist extremists and the secular regime would target the Islamists as potential threat to national security. 


### Why Egypt?

The Middle East and North Africa is a particularly interesting region in a way that only few anti-terror laws have been passed by the states despite experiencing the highest level of global terrorism. In fact, we can see from Figure 2, which is a normalized graph of the number of anti- terror laws passed per 100 terrorist attacks, that it is not only one of the few regions that did not see a surge in anti-terror law adoption after the 9/11, marked in a blue vertical line at year 2001, but also shows no significant performance in legal enactment in general despite the high level of terrorist attacks. 

This region is also an interesting place to look at the effect of anti-terror laws since the Islamist groups have always been either marginalized, repressed or coopted by the secularist dictatorships and monarchs. Egypt is one of the countries where political Islamist groups have been marginalized by the nationalist secular authorities since the 1960s. In fact, the Muslim Brotherhood has been outlawed in 2013 and criticized as a terrorist organization, but still a third of Egyptians support the Muslim Brotherhood, implying that there would be some kind of polarization among its population.

### Data and Methods

I use Arab Barometer survey data (2006-2019) to observe latent clusters within public opinion. Because Egypt adopted anti-terror in 2015, I use Wave 3 (2012-2014) and Wave 4 (2016-2017) to see how polarization exacerbated in Egypt after the enactment. 

Among various questionnaires, I included 20 of them for more variation across clusters. They include binary variables (e.g. urban/rural, male/female, voted/did not vote), categorical ordinal variable (e.g. not at all/once a month/once a week/daily, level of education) and continuous variable (e.g. age). Topics of the selected questionnaires include political participation, religious practices, media exposure and stances on economic and diplomatic issues.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Read survey dataset
abv3 <- read_csv("abv3.csv")
abv4 <- read_csv("abv4.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Subset for Egypt and 20 survey questions
egypt1 <- abv3 %>%
  filter(country == "Egypt") %>%
  select(country, wt, q13, q1002, q1012, q1004, q1001, q1003,
         q102, q105, q106, q20112, q210, q301, q404, q409, q513,
         q523, q605a, q609, q6105, q6101)

egypt2 <- abv4 %>%
  filter(country == "Egypt") %>%
  select(country, wt, q13, q1002, q1012, q1004, q1001, q1003,
         q102, q105, q106, q1072, q210, q301, q404, q409, q513,
         q523, q605a, q609, q6106, q6101)
```



### Preprocessing - Survey weight

To preprocess the data before analyzing, I account for the weight of the survey to get an ideal representation of the population. As for the first dataset (2012-2014), the weights range from 0.047 to 6.07 while that of the second dataset (2016-2017) range from 0.67 to 1.90. To keep the number of observations similar, I multiply the weights by 10 and round to a whole number. Then I duplicate the each observation by the rounded weight. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Account for weights
summary(egypt1$wt)
summary(egypt2$wt)

# Duplicated observations by weight*10
# and rounded to a whole number
wt1 <- egypt1 %>%
  mutate(wt10 = wt*10, wt_round = round(wt10, 0))
wt2 <- egypt2 %>%
  mutate(wt10 = wt*10, wt_round = round(wt10, 0))

egypt_wt1 <- wt1 %>%
  uncount(wt_round)
egypt_wt2 <- wt2 %>%
  uncount(wt_round)
```



### Normalize responses

In this section, I normalize the responses to convert them uniformly into a numeric vector that ranges from 0 to 1. For binary variables, I recode them into 0 or 1 and, as for the continuous variable (age), I divide the values by 61 as the oldest respondent in each period is 61 and 58 respectively. I rescale them ordinal categorical variables, I use scaling method, by replacing each ordinal categorical variable with the equation below: $$\frac{i-1/2}{M}$$ 

I reiterate this for Wave 4 as well. One thing to note is that there are questions that appear in Wave 3 but not in Wave 4. One important question is q20112 which asks respondents how much trust they have for the Muslim Brotherhood, which is an ideal indicator to measure public opinion on the organization that is outlawed by the government and is often framed as terrorist organization by the government. In this analysis I include this question for Wave 3 due to its significance, but instead in Wave 4, I add question q1072 (which again does not appear in Wave 3) on how much individuals are worried about terrorism.

### Number of clusters

According to the results of the three testing methods for optimal number of clusters - within sum of squares, average silhouette width and gap statistics - I choose to work with 9 clusters. 
According to within sum of squares method, 5 or 6 clusters seem fair for both periods. Meanwhile, the average silhouette width method gives us 2 clusters for the analysis. However, having 2 clusters would not account for enough variation within the Egyptian public opinion. The next nearest number of cluster that has similar average silhouette width is 6. Lastly, according to the gap statistics method, cluster 7 or 9 is the most optimal. I pick 9 clusters, which seem to work well according to all other methods. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Drop weight variables
egypt_1 <- select(egypt_1, -one_of(c("wt", "wt10", "country")))
egypt_2 <- select(egypt_2, -one_of(c("wt", "wt10", "country"))) 

##Optimal number of clusters
#fviz_nbclust(egypt_1, FUN = kmeans, method = "wss") #5 or 6
#fviz_nbclust(egypt_1, FUN = kmeans, method = "silhouette") #2
#fviz_nbclust(egypt_1, FUN = kmeans, method = "gap_stat") #7

#fviz_nbclust(egypt_2, FUN = kmeans, method = "wss") #5 or 6
#fviz_nbclust(egypt_2, FUN = kmeans, method = "silhouette") #2
#fviz_nbclust(egypt_2, FUN = kmeans, method = "gap_stat") #9
```

```{r figurename, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("period1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("period2.png")
```

```{r}
#Clustering Analysis
set.seed(2020)
egypt1_kmeans <- kmeans(na.omit(egypt_1),
                       centers = 9, # number of clusters
                       nstart = 100)
egypt2_kmeans <- kmeans(na.omit(egypt_2),
                       centers = 9, # number of clusters
                       nstart = 100)
```



### Prediction



```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Expert check
mean1 <- bind_cols(
  egypt_1,
  cluster = egypt1_kmeans$cluster) %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>% 
  summarise(across(everything(), list(mean)))

mean2 <- bind_cols(
  egypt_2,
  cluster = egypt2_kmeans$cluster) %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>% 
  summarise(across(everything(), list(mean)))

mean1 %>% knitr::kable(digits = 2)
mean2 %>% knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```



### PCA - Visualization

Since PCA1 and PCA2 only explain 38% of the data, the vizualization would not be as useful. 

```{r}
#PCA
principle_components1 <- prcomp(egypt_1, scale. = FALSE)
principle_components2 <- prcomp(egypt_2, scale. = FALSE)

# view the amount of variance explained
summary(principle_components1)

# create and visualize the group membership of observations in the components
bind_cols(
  as_tibble(principle_components1$x), 
  cluster = egypt1_kmeans$cluster) %>%
  ggplot(aes(PC1, PC2, color = factor(cluster))) + geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d() + facet_wrap(~ cluster) +
  labs(title = "Public Opinion Clusters and PCA (2012-2014)") + theme_minimal()

bind_cols(
  as_tibble(principle_components2$x), 
  cluster = egypt2_kmeans$cluster) %>%
  ggplot(aes(PC1, PC2, color = factor(cluster))) + geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d() + facet_wrap(~ cluster) +
  labs(title = "Public Opinion Clusters and PCA (2016-2017)") + theme_minimal() 
```


### Parellel coordinates plot

As an alternative, I plot a parellel coordinates plot which shows how each clusters are posited within or consisted of each variables, or, in this case, questionnaires. The figure below shows how the nine clusters contain information of the questionnaires. There is clearly differences across variables in terms of variance across clusters. For instance, the first few variables that are binary (e.g. gender, urban/rural) have higher variance than questions asking if they are concerned about terrorism (T2, q1072) or religiosity (T1, q609). 
 
```{r, include= FALSE}
#change as factor
mean1$cluster <- as.factor(mean1$cluster)
mean2$cluster <- as.factor(mean2$cluster)
```

```{r}
#Parellel coordinate plot
x <- ggparcoord(mean1, columns = c(2:3,6,9:11,14:19), 
                groupColumn = 'cluster', scale = 'globalminmax',
                showPoints = TRUE) + theme_bw() + scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE)

y <- ggparcoord(mean2, columns = c(2:3,6,9:11,14:19), 
                groupColumn = 'cluster', scale = 'globalminmax',
                showPoints = TRUE) + theme_bw() + scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE)

ggarrange(
  x, y, labels = c("T1", "T2"),
  common.legend = TRUE, legend = "bottom", nrow = 2
  )
```


The variable that I make a foundational reference is q605a, which is their response on political parties - secular vs. religious politial party. These are clusters of people who either responded they prefer Islamist political parties or secular political parties. 

Since question on the Muslim Brotherhood is not available for comparison in Wave 4, this is the closest comparable measurment I can get from the two datasets. The reason I pick 2 clusters instead of 1 is because I am only selecting clusters from one base variable, I might lose some explanatory power with just one cluster. Fortunately, if I choose two clusters for each 
 
We can see from both graphs that clusters 5 and 6 (T1) and 2 and 6 (T2) are groups of people who prefer Islamist groups - they are mostly from rural Egypt - while clusters 7 and 9 (T1) and 3 and 9 (T2) prefer secular groups, who are from the urban Egypt. It is also evident from T1 that clusters 5 and 6 are the ones who are most supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood (q20112), while their counterparts have the lowest rate of support and trust.

filter1 <- mean1 %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>% 
  filter(cluster == 6) %>%
  ungroup()

a <- mean1 %>%
  ggparcoord(columns = c(2:3,6,9:11,14:19), 
             groupColumn = 'cluster', scale = 'globalminmax', 
             showPoints = TRUE) + theme_bw() + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#E8E8E8", "#E8E8E8", "#E8E8E8", "#E8E8E8", "#69b3a2", 
                              "#69b3a2", "gold1", "#E8E8E8", "gold1")) 

b <- mean2 %>%
  ggparcoord(columns = c(2:3,6,9:11,14:19), 
             groupColumn = 'cluster', scale = 'globalminmax', 
             showPoints = TRUE) + theme_bw() + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#E8E8E8", "#69b3a2", "slateblue4", "#E8E8E8", "#E8E8E8",

  common.legend = FALSE, legend = "bottom", nrow = 2
  )
```

## Political Polarization 

From the summary below, we see the size (percentage) of each clusters. Before anti-terror law was adopted in Egypt, those who prefer Islamist political parties (cluster 5 and 6) account for 14.9% of the entire repondents while those who prefer secular political parties (cluster 7 and 9) account for 21.3%. 

In the post-treatment period or after the anti-terror law enactment, the overall trend shift slightly to the pro-Islamist stance. While those who prefer Islamist political parties (cluster 2 and 6) account for 25.5% of the entire repondents, those who prefer secular political parties (cluster 3 and 9) account for 16.9%. 

Overall, we see more respondents in each of the extreme stances (either pro-Islamist or pro-secularist respondents) in the 2016-2017 period, compared to the size of the moderates, which would be the rest of the clusters. The moderates in this aspect decreased in size from 63.8 to 57.6. This implies that the society has been somewhat polarized in terms of their opinion on politial parties and their ideologies. 

While there are more pro-Islamist groups within the survey respondents after the anti-terror law adoption, it is hard to conclude that pro-secular groups have changed their political stance or ideology. It could be due to the growing distrust and disappointment of the general public towards the government and the incumbent political party, which is prevalent in Arab region as a whole.
