### Research puzzle

I am interested in how Egyptian public opinion shifts after the adoption of anti-terror law in Egypt. Specifically, I am interested in exploring polarization between secularists and Islamists as anti-terror law, by nature, targets Islamist extremists and the secular regime would target the Islamists as potential threat to national security. 


### Data and Methods

I use Arab Barometer survey data (2006-2019) to observe latent clusters within public opinion. Because Egypt adopted anti-terror in 2015, I use Wave 3 (2012-2014) and Wave 4 (2016-2017) to see how polarization exacerbated in Egypt after the enactment. 

Among various questionnaires, I includeã…‡ 20 of them for more variation across clusters. They include binary variables (e.g. urban/rural, male/female, voted/did not vote), categorical ordinal variable (e.g. not at all/once a month/once a week/daily, level of education) and continuous variable (e.g. age). Topics of the selected questionnaires include political participation, religious practices, media exposure and stances on economic and diplomatic issues.


```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Read survey dataset
abv3 <- read_csv("abv3.csv")
abv4 <- read_csv("abv4.csv")

# Subset for Egypt and 20 survey questions
egypt1 <- abv3 %>%
  filter(country == "Egypt") %>%
  select(country, wt, q13, q1002, q1012, q1004, q1001, q1003,
         q102, q105, q106, q20112, q210, q301, q404, q409, q513,
         q523, q605a, q609, q6105, q6101)

egypt2 <- abv4 %>%
  filter(country == "Egypt") %>%
  select(country, wt, q13, q1002, q1012, q1004, q1001, q1003,
         q102, q105, q106, q1072, q210, q301, q404, q409, q513,
         q523, q605a, q609, q6106, q6101)
```


### Preprocessing - Survey weight

To preprocess the data before analyzing, I account for the weight of the survey to get an ideal representation of the population. As for the first dataset (2012-2014), the weights range from 0.047 to 6.07 while that of the second dataset (2016-2017) range from 0.67 to 1.90. To keep the number of observations similar, I multiply the weights by 10 and round to a whole number. Then I duplicate the each observation by the rounded weight. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Account for weights
summary(egypt1$wt)
summary(egypt2$wt)


# Duplicated observations by weight*10
# and rounded to a whole number
wt1 <- egypt1 %>%
  mutate(wt10 = wt*10, wt_round = round(wt10, 0))
wt2 <- egypt2 %>%
  mutate(wt10 = wt*10, wt_round = round(wt10, 0))

egypt_wt1 <- wt1 %>%
  uncount(wt_round)
egypt_wt2 <- wt2 %>%
  uncount(wt_round)
```

### Normalize responses

In this section, I normalize the responses to convert them uniformly into a numeric vector that ranges from 0 to 1. For binary variables, I recode them into 0 or 1 and, as for the continuous variable (age), I divide the values by 61 as the oldest respondent in each period is 61 and 58 respectively. I rescale them ordinal categorical variables, I use scaling method, by replacing each ordinal categorical variable with $$\frac{i-1/2}{M}$$.
