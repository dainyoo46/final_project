### Research Question

How does the Egyptian public opinion shift after the adoption of anti-terror law in 2015? As anti-terror law posits an enemy as a threat to national security and Islamist groups have been often targeted and criticized as a potential terrorist organization by secular regimes, I am interested in exploring exacerbating polarization between the secularists and the Islamists in Egypt after the law enactment. 

### Argument 

Polarization between secularists and Islamists after the adoption of anti-terror law will exacerbate after anti-terror law enactment.


### Why MENA? Why Egypt?

The Middle East and North Africa is a particularly interesting region in a way that only few anti-terror laws have been passed by the states despite experiencing the highest level of global terrorism. In fact, it is not only one of the few regions that did not see a surge in anti-terror law adoption after the 9/11, but also shows no significant performance in legal enactment in general despite the high level of terrorist attacks. This makes the case unique and puzzling as to what the effects of the law on the public opinion is.

This region is also an interesting place to look at the effect of anti-terror laws since the Islamist groups have always been either marginalized, repressed or coopted by the secularist dictatorships and monarchs. Egypt is one of the countries where political Islamist groups have been marginalized by the nationalist secular authorities since the 1960s. In fact, the Muslim Brotherhood has been outlawed in 2013 and criticized as a terrorist organization, but still a third of Egyptians support the Muslim Brotherhood, implying that there would be some kind of polarization among its population.
